        <p>Hello Iâ€™m Younes!<br/></p>
        <p>
        <br/> I'm currently studying in my second year of IT infrastructure, cyber security option at OFPPT ISMONTIC in Tangier.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/> My passion lies in cybersecurity, particularly in learning how to detect cyber attacks/threats and securing applications and networks.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/> I am also a big fan (a beginner as well) in CTFs (capture the flag), but I enjoy the challenge and strive to constantly improve my skills.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/> Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing video games in my free time. I believe that gaming provides not only an entertaining way to unwind, but also helps me to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/> With my strong interest in technology and cybersecurity, I'm eager to explore the many opportunities that this field has to offer, and I hope to make a positive impact through my work..
